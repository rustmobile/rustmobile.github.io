# Architecture

In this section we're going to talk about the architecture of this library

## Core

The heart of our library, it contains code that works independent from
the OS and the chip. The `core` of the library should be like any rust
library out there, our twist is porting it to other platforms.

## Glue

Porting our rust library requries us to write glue code, each platform has
its set of conventions they follow. Java has JNI (Java Native Interface) and
iOS uses C conventions.

## Core + Glue

So our architecture is making the logic inside of `core` using rust,
and our problem will be only about writing glue code.

```plantuml,format=svg
@startuml
!theme sketchy-outline

!$android = "Android\nKotlin/Java"
!$ios = "iOS\nSwift/Objective-C"
!$jni = "Java Native Interface"
!$c = "C Interface"
!$core = "Core Lib"

card "$ios"
card "$android"

component "Rust" {
  port "$c"
  port "$jni"
  card "$core"
}

"$ios" ~~> "$c"
"$android" ~~> "$jni"

"$c" ~~> "$core"
"$jni" ~~> "$core"
@enduml
```

Now when we want to introduce another platform, the web for an instance,
we only have to worry about writing a glue code to support web.

```plantuml,format=svg
@startuml
!theme sketchy-outline

!$android = "Android\nKotlin/Java"
!$ios = "iOS\nSwift/Objective-C"
!$web = "Web\nJavaScript"
!$jni = "Java Native Interface"
!$c = "C Interface"
!$wasm = "WASM"
!$core = "Core Lib"

card "$ios"
card "$android"
card "$web"

component "Rust" {
  port "$c"
  port "$jni"
  port "$wasm"
  card "$core"
}

"$ios" ~~> "$c"
"$android" ~~> "$jni"
"$web" ~~> "$wasm"

"$c" ~~> "$core"
"$jni" ~~> "$core"
"$wasm" ~~> "$core"
@enduml
```
